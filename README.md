# Here you can see my program languages and the progress.
# My prefered program languages are at the moment:
#
# C#, C++, JAVA, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, Python.
#
# Following there will probably be some more to follow
#
# Used program-languages at the past:
# VBA, VB, VB.Net, Lotus-Script, JavaScript, Delphi (Pascal).
#
# My developer vita:
# I start in ~ 1989 with Basic on an Amiga 500 (with 1MB RAM),
# my first "program" was a simple Math-Program for Changing Mathematics Formulas.
# Next I tried to change save-games in hexdezimal-code (small-cheating, offline game).
# At the German-Armee, I use VBA for Excel-Files.
#
# On my first job, after German-Armee, I work for a global company
# during this time we have developed a testfield-managment-program with different tools: 
# Lotus-Notes ("database") for create offline request + send request (with possible test environment) to the company,
# And I create 1x Software to read data from a Kern-Labor-Scales + bracket measuring screw mitutoyo (in VB) and write data to a Excel - GUI.
# Next we sample datas from 3 difference testbenches systems (Micoface, Schenck(Horiba) and LinkEng) to an MySQL Database.
# The plan was, to collect all Datas together (Lotus-Notes Request + manual Messurements + Test-Results from the testbenches)
# and save this datas inside a MySQL.
#
# Than I have change the company (after 12 years).
# On the last 13 years, I have work as commissioning engineer and software expert for a big testfield and with globaly customer as Software expert on Side.
# In this time I learned much: About Company-Networks, Oracle Databases in Networks.
# 
# Inside the opper folders you will find a small protfolio at my work.
